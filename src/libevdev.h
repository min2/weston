/**
 * @mainpage
 *
 * **libevdev** is a library for handling evdev kernel devices. It abstracts
 * the ioctls through type-safe interfaces and provides functions to change
 * the appearance of the device.
 *
 * Development of libevdev is discussed on
 * [input-tools@lists.freedesktop.org](http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/input-tools)
 * Please submit patches, questions or general comments there.
 *
 * Handling events and SYN_DROPPED
 * ===============================
 *
 * libevdev provides an interface for handling events, including most notably
 * SYN_DROPPED events. SYN_DROPPED events are sent by the kernel when the
 * process does not read events fast enough and the kernel is forced to drop
 * some events. This causes the device to get out of sync with the process'
 * view of it. libevdev handles this by telling the caller that a SYN_DROPPED
 * has been received and that the state of the device is different to what is
 * to be expected. It then provides the delta between the previous state and
 * the actual state of the device as a set of events. See
 * libevdev_next_event() for more information.
 *
 * Signal safety
 * =============
 *
 * libevdev is signal-safe for the majority of its operations. Check the API
 * documentation to make sure, unless explicitly stated a call is <b>not</b>
 * signal safe.
 *
 * Device handling
 * ===============
 *
 * libevdev does not attempt duplicate detection. Initializing two libevdev
 * devices for the same fd is valid and behaves the same as for two different
 * devices.
 *
 * libevdev does not handle the file descriptors directly, it merely uses
 * them. The caller is responsible for opening the file descriptors, setting
 * them to O_NONBLOCK and handling permissions.
 *
 * Where does libevdev sit?
 * ========================
 *
 * libevdev is essentially a `read(2)` on steroids for `/dev/input/eventX
 * devices. It sits below the process that handles input events, in between
 * the kernel and that process. In the simplest case, e.g. an evtest-like tool
 * the stack would look like this:
 *
 *      kernel → libevdev → evtest
 *
 * For X.Org input modules, the stack would look like this:
 *
 *      kernel → libevdev → xf86-input-evdev → X server → X client
 *
 * For Weston/Wayland, the stack would look like this:
 *
 *      kernel → libevdev → Weston → Wayland client
 *
 * libevdev does **not** have knowledge of X clients or Wayland clients, it is
 * too low in the stack.
 *
 * Example
 * =======
 * Below is a simple example that shows how libevdev could be used. This example
 * opens a device, checks for relative axes and a left mouse button and if it
 * finds them monitors the device to print the event.
 *
 * @code
 *      struct libevdev *dev = NULL;
 *      int fd;
 *      int rc = 1;
 *
 *      fd = open("/dev/input/event0", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK);
 *      rc = libevdev_new_from_fd(fd, &dev);
 *      if (rc < 0) {
 *              fprintf(stderr, "Failed to init libevdev (%s)\n", strerror(-rc));
 *              exit(1);
 *      }
 *      printf("Input device name: \"%s\"\n", libevdev_get_name(dev));
 *      printf("Input device ID: bus %#x vendor %#x product %#x\n",
 *             libevdev_get_bustype(dev),
 *             libevdev_get_vendor_id(dev),
 *             libevdev_get_product_id(dev));
 *      if (!libevdev_has_event_type(dev, EV_REL) ||
 *          !libevdev_has_event_code(dev, EV_KEY, BTN_LEFT)) {
 *              printf("This device does not look like a mouse\n");
 *              exit(1);
 *      }
 *
 *      do {
 *              struct input_event ev;
 *              rc = libevdev_next_event(dev, LIBEVDEV_READ_NORMAL, &ev);
 *              if (rc == 0)
 *                      printf("Event: %s %s %d\n",
 *                             libevdev_get_event_type_name(ev.type),
 *                             libevdev_get_event_code_name(ev.type, ev.code),
 *                             ev.value);
 *      } while (rc == 1 || rc == 0 || rc == -EAGAIN);
 * @endcode
 *
 * A more complete example is available with the libevdev-events tool here:
 * http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libevdev/tree/tools/libevdev-events.c
 *
 * libevdev internal test suite
 * ============================
 *
 * libevdev's internal test suite uses the
 * [Check unit testing framework](http://check.sourceforge.net/). Tests are
 * divided into test suites and test cases. Most tests create a uinput device,
 * so you'll need to run as root.
 *
 * To run a specific suite only:
 *
 *     export CK_RUN_SUITE="suite name"
 *
 * To run a specific test case only:
 *
 *     export CK_RUN_TEST="test case name"
 *
 * To get a list of all suites or tests:
 *
 *     git grep "suite_create"
 *     git grep "tcase_create"
 *
 * By default, check forks, making debugging harder. Run gdb as below to avoid
 * forking.
 *
 *     sudo CK_FORK=no CK_RUN_TEST="test case name" gdb ./test/test-libevdev
 *
 * A special target `make gcov-report.txt` exists that runs gcov and leaves a
 * `libevdev.c.gcov` file. Check that for test coverage.
 *
 * `make check` is hooked up to run the test and gcov (again, needs root).
 *
 * The test suite creates a lot of devices, very quickly. Add the following
 * xorg.conf.d snippet to avoid the devices being added as X devices (at the
 * time of writing, mutter can't handle these devices and exits after getting
 * a BadDevice error).
 *
 *     $ cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-ignore-libevdev-devices.conf
 *     Section "InputClass"
 *             Identifier "Ignore libevdev test devices"
 *             MatchProduct "libevdev test device"
 *             Option "Ignore" "on"
 *     EndSection

/**
 * @defgroup init Initialization and setup

 *
 * libevdev_set_fd() is the central call and initializes the internal structs

/**
 * @defgroup bits Querying device capabilities
 *
 * Abstraction functions to handle device capabilities, specificially
 * device propeties such as the name of the device and the bits
 * representing the events suppported by this device.
 *
 * The logical state returned may lag behind the physical state of the device.
 * libevdev queries the device state on libevdev_set_fd() and then relies on
 * the caller to parse events through libevdev_next_fd(). If a caller does not
 * use libevdev_next_fd(), libevdev will not update the internal state of the
 * device and thus returns outdated values.
 */

/**
 * @defgroup mt Multi-touch related functions
 * Functions for querying multi-touch-related capabilities. MT devices
 * following the kernel protocol B (using ABS_MT_SLOT) provide multiple touch
 * points through so-called slots on the same axis. The slots are enumerated,
 * a client reading from the device will first get an ABS_MT_SLOT event, then
 * the values of axes changed in this slot. Multiple slots may be provided in
 * before an EV_SYN event.
 *
 * As with @ref bits, the logical state of the device as seen by the library
 * depends on the caller using libevdev_next_event().

/**
 * @defgroup kernel Modifying the appearance or capabilities of the device
 *
 * Modifying the set of events reported by this device. By default, the
 * libevdev device mirrors the kernel device, enabling only those bits
 * exported by the kernel. This set of functions enable or disable bits as
 * seen from the caller.
 *
 * Enabling an event type or code does not affect event reporting - a
 * software-enabled event will not be generated by the physical hardware.
 * Disabling an event will prevent libevdev from routing such events to the
 * caller. Enabling and disabling event types and codes is at the library
 * level and thus only affects the caller.
 *
 * If an event type or code is enabled at kernel-level, future users of this
 * device will see this event enabled. Currently there is no option of
 * disabling an event type or code at kernel-level.
 */

/**
 * @defgroup misc Miscellaneous helper functions
 *
 * Functions for printing or querying event ranges. The list of names is

 * for each event type is compiled in and does not check the underlying
 * kernel.

/**
 * @defgroup events Event handling
 *
 * Functions to handle events and fetch the current state of the event. Generally,
 * libevdev updates its internal state as the event is processed and forwarded

 * to the caller's state. It may however lag behind the actual state of the device.
